1. Paper survey about (existing) solutions for:
	- function tracing of app Java + native code, middleware, syscalls
		> AOSP modification?
		> inline hooking apps?
		> emulator-based (e.g. VMI, emulator traces)?
	- network traffic tracing
	- interaction with app GUI

2. Setup of a trace framework (targeted at MW app + system components)

2,5. Evaluate and improve stealthiness

3. Management for installing target app on new emulator instance and running it with component & GUI exploration

3,5. Full automation of trace setup, app scheduling and app execution
	(including adaption to Sandnet APIs)

4. Improve and evaluate stealthiness and scalability (CPU & memory overhead)
