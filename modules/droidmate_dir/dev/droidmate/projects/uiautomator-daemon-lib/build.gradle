  This project contains classes that:
  - are reused by multiple projects,
  - some of which are to be deployed on an Android device.
  - do not require access to Android API (no android.jar).

  Because some of the classes are deployed on an Android Device, the classes in this project are compiled with Java 7.

 * This build.script is executed twice, once from normal build and once from uiautomator2-daemon build. The applied script
 * allows to install to local maven repo and so can be applied only once. ":projects" doesn't exist when calling this script

 * For more details why such strange setup, see settings.gradle in uiautoamtor2-daemon.
